***Description***
Welcome to Halmstad University! Can you exploit it on the first day?


***Solution***
It's a Simple Python script which takes input, base64-decodes it and then unpickles it. Unpickling user input is unsafe, as arbitrary pickle objects can be injected leading to remote code execution. A good article about this can be found here: https://checkoway.net/musings/pickle/
Use the canonical Python pickle shellcode from the article or run the following Python code that will generate a pickle shellcode (exploit.py script).
It will generate the following Base64-encrypted pickle shellcode and provide it as input to the script:

"Y3N1YnByb2Nlc3MKUG9wZW4KcDAKKChTJy9iaW4vc2gnCnAxCnRwMgp0cDMKUnA0Ci4="

It will execute /bin/sh and give us a shell, so now open "flag.txt" to get the flag
