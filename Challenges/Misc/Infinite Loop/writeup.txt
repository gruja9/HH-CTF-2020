***Solution***
It's a loop where each zip file's password is the name of the next zip file (without the .zip extension). Create a script to extract them automatically until the "flag.zip" file is extracted. It's then protected with another password that you can crack with "fcrackzip":
"fcrackzip -D -p /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -u flag.zip"
And there is the flag.
