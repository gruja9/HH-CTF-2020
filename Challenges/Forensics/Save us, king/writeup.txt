***Description***
(The challenge is borrowed from CTF 2019.)
Save me, king, my code is saying something is out of index. This is making my head hurt.


***Solution***
The file obviously has a broken header that we need to repair in order to view the image. Open it with a hexeditor ("hexeditor save_us") and edit the first 5 bytes to:
"FF D8 FF E0 00"
Open the image now with "xdg-open save_us" and you will find the flag there.

flag{kung3n_Ã¤r_4rg}
