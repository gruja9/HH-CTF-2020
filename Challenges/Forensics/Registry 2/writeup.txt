***Description***
(The challenge is borrowed from CTF 2019.)
Mission: Your mission should you choose to accept it:
1. Find the name of the document that was accessed.                                                                  
2. Find the name of the program that was executed.


***Solution***
1. Mount the NTUSER.DAT registry file with "chntpw -e NTUSER.DAT" and navigate to "Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\RecentDocs" and run "type 1" to read from the value named "1" and you will get the first part of the flag:
"flag{s3cr3ts_1n

2. Now navigate to "Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\UserAssist" and you will see numerous keys. Trying each one and going in "Count" should reveal that the "{CEBFF5CD-ACE2-4F4F-9178-9926F41749EA}" key has a lot of values in there. The last value is actually a file with the "cneg2- _e3t15gel_15_p0zz0a}" filename, which seems to be reserved. Running it with ROT13 reveals the second part of the flag:
"_r3g15try_15_c0mm0n}"

flag{s3cr3ts_1n_r3g15try_15_c0mm0n}
