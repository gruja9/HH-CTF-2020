The file is a JPEG file of me hacking a bank. 

This image contains another file. 

To extract the file, a tool such as steghide can be used.

However, a password is required to extract this data.

A tool like stegocracker can be used to run a wordlist against the image file.

Ex:
stegocracker me_hacking_bank.jpg /wordlists/rockyou.txt

The program will run through the 'rokyou.txt' wordlist until it finds a password that is able to
extract data from the image. 

Once it has found the password, steghide can be used to extract the data:

steghide extract -sf me_hacking_bank.jpg
Password: hacker

A file will be extracted; secret_message.txt > hex_decoded.txt

cat'ing this file shows a long string of alphanumeric characters.

The string has been converted to hexadecimal, to convert the hexadecimal to ascii a tool
such as 'xxd' can be used.

Ex: 
cat secret_message.txt | xxd -r -p 

Now the string has been converted from hexadecimal, but it is still not fully decoded.

The string is now encoded in base64, the way you can tell is usually by the padding at the end
("=="), and by the alphanumeric characters.

To decode this you can simply use the base64 tool with the '-d'(decode) flag

Ex:
cat hex_decoded.txt | base64 -d > output

Of course this could have been done in one line:
cat secret_message.txt | xxd -r -p | base64 -d

The flag has now been decoded!

Flag: hhctf_flag{s3cr3t_f1l3s}
