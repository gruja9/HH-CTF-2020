A png file is supplied.

Using tools like 'file' or 'exiftool' shows nothing strange.

The file has been embeded with a zip file.

To detect if a file has other files within and extract them, a tool such as 'binwalk' or 'foremost' can be used.

Ex:
binwalk -e Password_Retrieval.png
foremost Password_Retrieval.png

Since this is a png file, you could even unzip this file with the 'unzip' tool.

A zip file will have been extracted. It's contents is a secret message.

The text is Morse code, you can tell by the slashes(/) signifying spaces 
However the dashes (-) are replaced by 1's, and the dots (.) replaced by 0's.

You can manually replace the dots and dashes, or you can make it easy by using 'sed'.

sed 's/1/-/g; s/0/\./g' secret_message.txt

This sed command replaced all 1's with dashes(-), and 0's with dots(.). 

From here, a online tool can be used to translate the morse code into text. 

Done!
