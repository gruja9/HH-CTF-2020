The challenge is several different encrypted zip files. The file within the zip file is the pasword for the first zip files.

Ex:
File1
-----File2
----------File3
---------------FIle4

Where the password for File1, is File2. The password for File2 is File3 and so on.

However the password(the name of th file) is hashed by multilitple different cryptographic functions.

The first file (123456789.zip) has a file within that is a long string of numbers and
letters. You can see this by using the unzip command with the -l(list) flag: unzip -l
123456789.zip

The first filename is hased with sha384.
The second filename is hashed with sha256.
The third filename is hashed with sha512.
The fourth filename is hashed with md5.
The fifth filename is hashed with sha1.

These hashes can be broken by simply pasting them into an online hash lookup tool such as:
https://md5decrypt.net/en/
or
https://hashes.com/en/decrypt/hash

A more advanced meathod to completely ignore the actual challenge would be to use a tool like
JohnTheRipper or fcrackzip to break the password for the zip file. 

Example of how it could be done with John and a wordlist: 
zip2john 123456789.zip > Output_file
john --wordlist=/path/to/wordlist Output_file
